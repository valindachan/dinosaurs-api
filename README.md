# dinosaurs-api

We're creating a RESTful API for our dinosaur collection. I added API endpoints that will allow you to read, create, delete and edit dinosaurs from the program.

This API gives you the following information about dinosaurs:

* An identifying primary key
* A name
* A color
* A size/weight
* A set of habitats that it may belong to
